# Influenza in the US

## Research Context
Influenza outbreaks in the United States occur seasonally, leading to an increased number of flu cases. Vulnerable populations, particularly individuals aged 65 and older, are at a higher risk of developing severe complications that may require hospitalization. This seasonal surge places additional strain on hospitals and clinics, necessitating temporary medical staff to meet demand.

A medical staffing agency provides these additional healthcare professionals, including nurses, physician assistants, and doctors, to support hospitals and clinics during peak flu seasons. Efficient allocation of medical personnel is critical to ensuring adequate patient care while optimizing resource use.

### Relevant Stakeholders
- **Medical agency frontline staff** (nurses, physician assistants, and doctors)
- **Hospitals and clinics** utilizing the staffing agencyâ€™s services
- **Influenza patients**
- **Staffing agency administrators**

## Project Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to determine the optimal timing and approach for shifting temporary medical staff between states to address seasonal flu outbreaks. This involves developing a staffing plan that reallocates available personnel based on demand without necessitating additional resources.

### Scope
The agency covers all hospitals across the 50 U.S. states, and this project aims to plan for the upcoming influenza season.

### Key Goals
- Provide insights to inform staffing decisions by analyzing data on influenza trends and spatial distribution.
- Determine whether influenza follows a seasonal pattern nationwide and whether its onset and duration vary across states.
- Prioritize states with large vulnerable populations by categorizing them into **low, medium, or high-need** based on population risk factors.
- Identify data limitations that may impact analysis and decision-making.

## Guiding Questions
- When does influenza activity peak in different states?
- How can we predict staffing needs based on historical trends?
- What factors influence the variation in influenza severity across states?
- How do vulnerable populations correlate with hospitalization rates?

## Data

### Data Sources
- **US Census Bureau Data**: Provides population data and age distribution. [Dataset link](https://coach-courses-us.s3.amazonaws.com/public/courses/data-immersion/A1-A2_Influenza_Project/Census_Population_transformed_202101.csv)
- **CDC Dataset**: Contains influenza-related deaths by state. [Dataset link](https://wonder.cdc.gov/ucd-icd10.html)

### Data Wrangling & Cleaning
- Data cleaning, integration, and transformation
- Handling missing values and inconsistencies
- Aggregation of data for state-level analysis

## Methods
- **Hypothesis testing** to determine statistical significance of trends
- **Data visualization** for identifying patterns
- **Predictive modeling** for forecasting staffing needs

## Results & Visualizations
Detailed analysis results are available in the project script. A visual presentation of key findings has been compiled on Tableau and can be accessed here: [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/da77/viz/2_09_Storyboard_JT/00Storyboard).

## Limitations
- **Data Constraints**: Death certificates list only a single cause of death, potentially overlooking related illnesses and chronic conditions. This may result in an overestimation of influenza-related mortality.
- **Geographic Variations**: Differences in reporting methods across states may introduce inconsistencies in data interpretation.
- **Availability of Real-Time Data**: The lag in official reporting may limit real-time decision-making for staffing needs.

## Ethical Considerations
- **Privacy and Confidentiality**: Ensuring patient data is anonymized and used responsibly.
- **Resource Allocation**: Equitable distribution of medical staff to prioritize high-need areas without neglecting other regions.
- **Accuracy and Bias**: Addressing potential biases in data collection and interpretation to avoid misinformed staffing decisions.
