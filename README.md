# Influenza in the US 

## Research Context
The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual
suffer from the flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop serious
complications and end up in the hospital. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to
adequately treat these extra patients. The medical staﬃng agency provides this temporary
staff. Influenza deaths pose a challenge to the US healthcare system. Especially the vulnerable population aged 65+ is at risk.

Relevant stakeholders: Medical agency frontline staff (nurses, physician assistants, and doctors)
● Hospitals and clinics using the staﬃng agency’s services
● Influenza patients
● Staﬃng agency administrators

## Project Objectives 
Objective: Determine when to send staff, and how many, to each state.A staﬃng plan that utilizes all available agency staff per state requirements, without
necessitating additional resources
Scope: The agency covers all hospitals in each of the 50 states of the United States, and
the project will plan for the upcoming influenza season.

- Provide information to support a staﬃng plan, detailing what data can help inform the timing
and spatial distribution of medical personnel throughout the United States.
- Determine whether influenza occurs seasonally or throughout the entire year. If seasonal,
does it start and end at the same time (month) in every state?
- Prioritize states with large vulnerable populations. Consider categorizing each state as low-
,
medium-
, or high-need based on its vulnerable population count.
- Assess data limitations that may prevent you from conducting your desired analyses.

## Guiding Questions
1.	Is there evidence to support the common assumption of a positive linear relationship between BMI, age, smoking, and healthcare costs?
2.	How do health variables (such as smoking and BMI) differ between genders? Do these differences also translate into varying healthcare charges by gender?
3.	How is obesity (BMI) related to smoking? Is there a positive linear relationship between the two?
4.	What types of regional differences can be detected in healthcare costs and health factors?
